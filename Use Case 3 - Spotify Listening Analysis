# Spotify Platform Engagement Analysis (Use Case 3)
**Optimizing listening experiences across devices**  
*Analyzing 150K+ plays to reduce skips and increase session duration*


---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Use Case 3: Platform-Specific Optimization**
**Business Question:**  
*"How do listening behaviors differ across platforms, and how can we tailor experiences to boost engagement?"*

**Key Objectives:**  
1. Compare engagement metrics (duration/skips) across 6+ platforms  
2. Identify platform-specific pain points (e.g., mobile vs. desktop)  
3. Recommend device-aware improvements  


## ðŸ“Š **Key Findings**
### 1. Platform Engagement Gaps
| Platform       | Avg. Duration (min) | Skip Rate | Shuffle Usage |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Mac**        | 4.2                 | 1.1%      | 52%           |
| **Android**    | 3.1                 | 2.3%      | 74%           |
| **Web Player** | 3.8                 | 1.2%      | 61%           |

**Insight:** Mobile apps have 26% shorter sessions than desktop (*p<0.01*).

### 2. Temporal Patterns by Platform  

- **Mobile peaks:** 8 AM (commute) and 5 PM (gym)  
- **Desktop peaks:** 7-9 PM (focused listening)  

### 3. Skip Triggers
- **Android:** 43% of skips occur in first 30 seconds  
- **Web Player:** Lowest skip rate for playlist-initiated plays  



ðŸ’¡ Recommendations
For Mobile:

Test: 15-second previews before auto-play to reduce early skips

Design: Larger skip button during commute hours (8-9 AM)

For Desktop:

Feature: "Deep Listening Mode" with longer track sequences

UI: Promote album play in evening hours

Cross-Platform:

Algorithm: Device-aware shuffle (e.g., fewer skips on mobile)



ðŸ“ˆ Impact Metrics

Mobile session length	+15%
Overall skip rate	-20%
